# PromptBox

This utility allows maintaining libraries of LLM prompt templates which can be filled in and submitted from the command
line.

# Template Files

- are built in TOML
- can use Liquid templating, and reference templates in other files
- define command-line arguments, which can include references to files

```toml
# File: summarize.pb.toml

description = "Summarize some files"

# This can also be template_path to read from another file.
template = '''
Create a {% if formal %}formal{% else %}informal{% endif %} summary of the below files
which are on the topic of {{topic}}. The summary should be about {{ len }} sentences long.

{%- for f in file -%}
File {{ f.filename }}:
{{ f.contents }}


{%- endfor -%}
'''

[model]
# These model options can also be defined in a config file to apply to the whole directory of templates.
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
temperature = 0.7
# Also supports top_p, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty, stop, and max_tokens

[options]
len = { type = "int", description = "The length of the summary", default = 4 }
topic = { type = "string", description = "The topic of the summary" }
formal = { type = "boolean" }
file = { type = "file", array = true, description = "The files to summarize" }
```

This template could then be run with a command like `promptbox run summarize --formal --file cafe.txt --file bistro.txt --topic
food`.

# Configuration Files

Each directory of templates contains a configuration file, which can set default model options. Config files are read
from the current directory up through the parent directories, and the global configuration directory such as
`.config/promptbox/promptbox.toml` is read as well.

A configuration file inherits settings from the config files in its parent directories as well, for those options that
it does not set itself.
